  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br />
      Let's 
    Get to Work is a high-energy project uniting 28 artists and 
    two artist/curators from Europe, the Middle East, and the United States.&nbsp; 
    This collective will contribute objects, plans, writings, ideas, and new media 
    works towards the building of an ideal or (un)ideal city. The initial exhibition 
    group of 12 British artists was conceived by Gavin Wade and debuted at the 
    Marcel Sitcoske Gallery in April, 2000.&nbsp; The expanded version, co-curated 
    by Wade and Jonathan VanDyke, premiered at the Susquehanna Art Museum in July, 
    2001 and travels to other venues across the US. 
  </p><p>Let's 
    Get To Work proposes a city where the artists construct new 
    systems and structures towards a new ecology. The exhibition acts as a developmental 
    stage, pushing the gallery space as open-ended research.&nbsp; Let's Get to 
    Work re-thinks public and private spaces and the nature of human relationships 
    in context of our built environment. The artists utilize concept- and process-oriented 
    methods emphasizing viewer and site. They envision a shift in the design of 
    our culture.&nbsp; Let's Get to Work can be seen as a template for a new city, 
    a microcosm of "a new reality" and a territory for discovery and critique. 
  </p><p>The 
    Let's Get to Work exhibition and publication will grow 
    out of a team-oriented approach and emerge as a multi-layered whole. Certain 
    works will overlap, while many will take advantage of under-utilized spaces 
    such as closets, basements, stairways, and the building exterior, establishing 
    new contexts for individual pieces. </p>
