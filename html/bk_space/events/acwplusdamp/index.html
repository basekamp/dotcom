<p><em><strong>Together Again</strong></em> is an exhibition by two related collaborative groups. The <strong>DAMP</strong> collective from Melbourne, and Torino-based collaborative art group <strong>A 
                Constructed World</strong> have worked together and independently to create 
                artworks that explore the relationship between art and audience through video, 
      photography, painting, publishing and live events. </p>

  DAMP</strong><br />
    The collaborative art group, DAMP, have worked together in various guises 
        since 1995. Over these ten years the group has comprised of over 69 artists. 
        Through performances, actions, video and object making they have created artworks 
        that explore the complicated relationships between art and audiences. The 
        work of DAMP could be described as funny social research experiments gone 
        terribly wrong that once completed, are usually documented for future audiences 
        to contemplate and interpret. <br />

<p><strong>A Constructed World</strong><br />
      Geoff Lowe and Jacqueline Riva began working collaboratively as A Constructed 
      World in 1993 when they founded Artfan magazine. Since then they have worked 
      with video, photography, painting, publishing and events. Their projects seek 
      to blur thresholds between sending and receiving and they have facilitated 
      many collaborative workshops including people from varying backgrounds and 
      practices, in New York, London, Melbourne, and Torino, working with groups 
      such as Wild Kingdom, Art Crew, Rosebud, KinK, Life with Us, Crack of Noon 
      and have worked in collaboration with artist group DAMP.<br />

  Explaining Contemporary Art to Live 
              Eels <br />
      A Constructed World<br />
      </strong>In 1965 
              Joseph Beuys made the work <em>How To Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare,</em> in which he walked around a gallery with his face smeared with honey and covered 
              in gold leaf, carrying a dead hare to whom he talked, explaining the pictures 
              before them. The audience for this performance was kept outside, only able 
              to see the goings on from behind a clear screen. There are various versions 
              of exactly what he did but it was concerned with explaining what was unknowable.            In 2004, in an expanded field, A Constructed 
              World will offer a performance and video work called explaining contemporary 
              art to live eels. The live eels swim around a group show before being returned 
              to the pond, the river, the ocean and ultimately the bottom of the Sargasso 
              sea. This work is also about explaining what we don&#8217;t-know, yet we see 
              what is outside our possession and not-known as a resource to be shared. The 
              exhibition made by artists from More Fools in Town will be placed in an aquatic 
              environment and the live audience of eels and humans will be free to move 
              around and look at the exhibition and each other looking. There is so little that is documented and 
              understood about eels, they cross roads at night (sleep in haystacks) to get 
              back to the river then the ocean then their breeding ground where they basically 
              procreate to death at the bottom of the deepest part of the ocean. The tiny 
              new spawn then travel thousands of kilometers to the habitats where we experience 
              them. No eel has ever been born in captivity. They can live for months in 
              low vibe in a freezer, they can be extremely hardy but are now declining in 
              numbers. <em><strong>explaining contemporary art to 
              live eels</strong></em> will be presented on three continents by A Constructed 
              World in 2004-2005 and this will be presented at Basekamp in Philadelphia 
              in a group show with Melbourne group/collective DAMP. This work will also 
              be accompanied by the ACW video work, Big Dirty Love, and made in collaboration 
    with sound artist Steve Piccolo.</p>

  Suddenly... a face 
              melting solo<br />
      DAMP<br />
      </strong>Over 
              the preceding year the collaborative group DAMP from Melbourne invited friends, 
              colleagues and other groups from around the world to shoot short 30 second 
              videos. Each scene was to contain an object entering the frame and a different 
              object exiting. Damp then filmed, connecting scenarios using these objects 
              as links. What results is a chain reaction of sorts, which inextricably takes 
              the members of the group, through a mega-narrative loop via various communities, 
              times, continents and random humorous events. The aim was to track the small 
              turns of fate that connects and separates each of us to one another. This video loop will be accompanied by a 
              series of over 120 drawings which illustrate this game of six degrees of separation 
              to an extreme conclusion and by an installation and other objects which further 
    utilize these seemingly 'dead' endings as means for new beginnings.</p>
<p><strong>Air Guitar Competition<br />
      Thursday Night Dec 2nd, 6:00 - 10:00 pm<br />
      </strong>In 
              great rock tradition DAMP is keen to hold an air guitar competition as a way 
              of meeting people and having a good time. Participants are invited free of 
              charge to cut out and paint their own guitars and perform their favorite songs 
              in front of large 'Damplifier' paintings. The Air Guitar workshop is open 
              to all and will take place at BASEKAMP during the week leading up to the exhibition 
              opening. To register or for more information, please email or call BASEKAMP 
    (contact info below). </p>
