  <p><strong>Grubstake, by Natures Radio</strong><br />
    May 15 - June 12, 2004 </p>
  <p><strong>Opening Reception:</strong> <br />
  May 15, 6-10pm<br />
  BASEKAMP, Philadelphia </p>
  <p>The Grubstake exhibition is about homesteading and staking a claim. The Natures 
    Radio group is creating artwork, but through collaboration they are also creating 
    a social arrangement. This idea of the prospectors&#8217; grubstake is being 
    used to frame the social structure they are constructing in the gallery.</p>
  <p>Grubstake exhibition borrows it&#8217;s title from a term originally used 
    to describe resources and land given to gold prospectors, in hopes of gaining 
    big returns. A grubstake was an investment through money or property used 
    to produce more wealth. As part of their exhibition, the BASEKAMP site is 
    offered as a foundation for building a collaborative homestead, and the Natures 
    Radio group is producing their own currency to be used as a resource.</p>
  <p>In this exhibition, physical limits of the BASEKAMP space give way to alternate 
    dimensions brought about thro through the group&#8217;s combined vision and 
    shared values. The artists are not literally breaking ground, but breaking 
    through spatial and social barriers - expanding a given area to become an 
    endless space, through illusion and richness of imagination. </p>
  <p>Natures Radio decided on their name during a camping trip last fall, while 
    staying at a campground administered by a very strict, environmentally rigorous 
    policy. In particular, excessive noise was frowned upon - no radios allowed. 
    An article was posted outside the bathrooms outlining the harsh rule system. 
    It was called &quot;Given a Chance, Sometimes Nature's Radio Makes the Most 
    Amazing Sounds,&quot; inviting the artists to open their ears to the world 
    around them.</p>
  <p>The Grubstake exhibition is about land use, building relationships, misusing 
    space, creating community, and expanding dimensions. The exhibition space 
    is inherently social in its division and dispersal as the BASEKAMP site itself 
    is offered as a &#8216;grubstake&#8217; for the group. In this exhibition, 
    the space essentially begins as a vacant lot, containing an abandoned structure 
    left standing from the previous exhibition. This open space becomes common 
    ground to this large group of artists, who are staking a claim with a joint 
    interest in its return.</p>
