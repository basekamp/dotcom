  <h2>The American Funeral Home</h2>

  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>The 
        Institute for Advanced Architecture is pleased to present a glimpse into one 
        of its latest projects, The American Funeral Home. With this project, the 
        Institute has undertaken a survey of the nation's memorial spaces, and in 
        partnership with BASEKAMP of Philadelphia, is now making this presentation 
        accessible to the public.<br />
        The exhibition presents a number of materials-- documentary photographs, interpretive 
        drawings, a textual guide and specially fabricated funerary accessories.</p>
  <p>These are the result of careful collaboration by scholars, engineers, and 
        artists from various fields, coming together to produce works for the purpose 
        of helping the nation practice for death, an activity vital to its self-esteem.</p>
  <p>In addition to selections from a photographic survey of &nbsp;American funerary 
        facilities, there are here presented studied extrapolations of important national 
        trends which will serve as both interventions and seeds of ritual formation.<br />
        These include Abolesco, which brings together industry and the sacred for 
        the design of a contemporary mass-produceable coffin/ distribution system 
        that is adaptable to today's lifestyles. &nbsp;The Simetery is a computer 
        application we have developed, using the latest cross platform technology, 
        to help interactively design &nbsp;spaces of remembrance.<br />
        Inspired by funeral-home innovations, the entire exhibition is carefully lit 
        using what we call the Natural Light system, which employs smart technology 
        which we hope can be a foretaste of life and death alternatives to come.</p>
