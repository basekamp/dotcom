<h2>alt.SPACE Festival </h2>
<p class="blackbar">About the alt.SPACE Festival in Philadelphia</p>
<p>&quot;alt.SPACE Festival&quot; in Philadelphia is a series of events which focus on alternative conceptions, research methods, and experimental approaches by artists to spatial networks within this city.</p>
<p>All the events take place in different spaces within the city, proposing active and critical reflections on questions such as access, distribution, ownership and uses of these spaces.</p>
<p>&quot;Spaces&quot; are broadly defined to include various systems within Philadelphia, such as it's privately owned public transit underground thoroughfares; the management and trading of it's local and imported water; it's communication and information networks (wifi and instant messaging); it's sound-scapes (radio and air spaces).</p>
<p>alt.SPACE, Philadelphia is linked to the alt.SPACE Festival in London this summer, and will hold a 24 hour long conference between the two cities at the end of July. See the calendar for details about this and the preceding events in Philadelphia throughout the month of July.</p>
<p class="blackbar">List of alt.SPACE  Events, Philadelphia</p>
<p><strong>1) Bring The War Home</strong><br />
  When: July 4, 12 noon<br />
  Where: Basekamp space &amp; vicinity. 723 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia<br />
  What: As it is the 4th of July (Independence Day in the US), we begin the alt.SPACE Festival in Philadelphia by taking part in Red76&rsquo;s Bring the War Back Home project &ndash; simultaneously broadcast in Philadelphia and London. In Philadelphia, audio clips from the background of soldiers' video blogs are blasted into the streets from an apparently unknown source (a proposal by Red76 - http://www.red76.com). <br />
</p>
<p><strong>2) Trespassing on Public Property</strong><br />
  When: July 8, 12 noon<br />
  Where: Meet at the fountain in the lobby of the Benjamin Franklin Hotel. 834 Chestnut St, Philadelphia<br />
  What: We'll be investigating Privately owned, Publicly accessible spaces in Philadelphia&ndash;starting with the historic lobby of the Benjamin Franklin Hotel. Beyond this initial time &amp; place, the event will be self-directed by members of the alt.SPACE research groups in Philadelphia.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>3) &quot;Business Class&quot; Train Meeting</strong><br />
  When: July 14, 12 noon<br />
  Where: Meet at Basekamp space. 723 Chestnut St, Philadelphia. We will then catch a subway-surface line to Frankford.<br />
  What: A &quot;Business class&quot; train meeting while traveling through north philly, during which we give presentations and all make participatory diagrams using dry erase markers on the train windows. Stephen Wright will be joining us from Paris to present on Usership in art.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>4) Audio Event: Soundtracks at PIFAS</strong><br />
  When: July 15, 9 p.m.<br />
  Where: The Philadelphia Institute for Advanced Study (PIFAS). 1712 N. 2nd St.<br />
  What: Soundtracks, as presented by the Acoustic Perceptions Research Group of the Philadelphia Institute for Advanced Study, investigates the shape of sound in a cinematic context. A collage which splinters the casual stroll of the viewer through genre postcards, animated icons, and the stillness of nature serves the spirit of interpretation and facilitates &quot;CAPTCHA&quot; moments, where meaning may be obscured contextually while remaining completely transparent. Without suspecting the ecstatic, the A&gt;p&gt;r&gt;g submits, with revery alone, a caustic, shapeless substance to flow and react in the eyes of experience.</p>
<p>More about PIFAS:<br />
  The Philadelphia Institute for Advanced Study has dedicated itself since its inception in January 2007 to public, freely available scholarship, and to techniques which can be used, studied, and modified without restriction. Facilities include the Center for Frontiers Real and Imagined, our Clay Pigeon Salon of Inscrutable Objects, and the Richard Rorty Center for Philosophical Research.<br />

</p>
<p><strong>5) Spatial Apocrypha</strong><br />
  When: July 18-25<br />
  What: A project organized by The Structure and Metaphor Study Group, which consists of a half dozen artists engaged in an ongoing inquiry into issues of cognition and perception, meaning and representation, and systems of organization and expression. In this event each artist has one week to privately enact and document an artistic practice, performance or installation in a public or semi-public space for no audience. The artists will then reconvene, present and assess their experiments. This project is intended to be a challenge to bounded notions of space as well as an exercise in creating an entirely mediated representation of a spatially and temporally situated artistic practice.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>6) Show Someone How You Feel About Something</strong><br />
  When: July 19, 23, 24, 30, and 31, 12 noon<br />
  Where: Meet at fountain in the center of Rittenhouse Square, Center City Philadelphia<br />
  What: A public, participatory drawing project organized by Zoe Cohen. Facilitators will have clipboards, paper, drawing materials, envelopes, postage, and a list of names and addresses of public/elected officials at the city, state, regional, national, and global levels. Participants who we attract by approaching directly on the street, will make a drawing to show someone how they feel about something. They are encouraged to communicate mainly through the image, and to use text only for a title or short &quot;caption&quot; for the image. We might photo-document the drawing after it is done, before the participant puts it in an envelope. We will then collect envelopes to mail ourselves, to ensure they make it to the mailbox. This project offers people a possibility of interacting, being, and communicating differently than is the norm in public and civic space.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>7) T.A.G.</strong><br />
  When: TBA<br />
  Where: TBA<br />
  What: The Temporary Autonomous Gallery (T.A.G.) is a project in which artists and guerilla curators take over a public space, briefly stripping visual art of its institutional and commercial aspects and reclaiming it in the name of Bohemia. Participants email electronic images of their works that are then printed out and hung at the &ldquo;gallery&rdquo;. Artists and guests receive information about the time and location of the T.A.G. the day before the &ldquo;opening&rdquo;. T.A.G. then inhabits that public space without asking permission for two hours or until thrown out. This project is being organized by Paul Falzone.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>8) Recording Texts: Part of the Collective Playlist</strong><br />
  When: TBA<br />
  Where: TBA<br />
  What: We will pick a few short theoretical texts and stage a reading-aloud event. A single text will be passed from person to person, to distribute the work of reading, and also simultaneously be recorded, to fit within the scheme of fair-use. These events would then have primary benefits for the immediate group of individuals at the reading and secondary benefits via download from the Collective Playlist.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>9) Bumper Futbol</strong><br />
  When: July 22, 12 noon<br />
  Where: Underground Pedestrian Concourse at City Hall, Philadelphia<br />
  What: We'll be playing soccer in the underground pedestrian concourse -- a large but rarely used public space in Philadelphia -- using this opportunity to explore &quot;hidden&quot; public space and its uses, as well as the goal-oriented and teamwork aspects of sports and gaming.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>10) Thinking about Communal Space</strong><br />
  When: July 22, 4 p.m.<br />
  Where: Basekamp space, 723 Chestnut St., Philadelphia<br />
  What: A presentation and discussion of research on communal spaces, featuring Kim F&ouml;rster of AnArchitektur (Berlin) and Lars Fischer of the Institute for Advanced Architecture (New York). Of interest is the role of community within the larger sphere of society, as well as the political implications of the common space. We will be looking at how space shapes community, identity, thought, and action and how to apply this to developing communal spaces that embrace both permeabilities and divisions.</p>
<p>If space were location and implementation of political conditions and<br />
  politics were to construct itself only with recourse to the communal as<br />
  the insurmountable horizon the common space would be the the most<br />
  political and and conflict ridden place imaginable. This is for us an<br />
  interesting place. ~AnArchitektur</p>

</p>
<p><strong>11) 24 Hour &quot;Conference&quot;</strong><br />
  When: July 28, beginning time TBA<br />
  Where: Basekamp space, 723 Chestnut St., Philadelphia<br />
  What: 24 hour &quot;conference&quot; between London and Philadelphia, where both cities will present results of all the events, which by then will have already happened, over the month of July.<br />
  Joseph del Pesco of the Collective Foundation (San Francisco) will also be joining us to discuss and continue the Collective Playlist. </p>
