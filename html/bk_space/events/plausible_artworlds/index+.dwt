How can produce and disseminate different knowledges of what art and artworld is, has been, can become? What role does collectivity and collaboration play in art history, in its writing as well as in what it writes? What kind of models and prototypes exists historically for collective and collaborative practice, and what does these prototypes open up to? What models for collective practice can we find outside of the field traditionally defined as artistic practice? What is the relevance of the kind of art historical trajectories we produce to how we think our various contemporary forms of artistic practice? To what extent must artists also be art historians?
