<p><strong>Friday, January 16th @ 7pm: opening reception</strong><br />
    <em>* See farther below for weekly events. </em></p>
<p>An Atlas is a traveling exhibition of artists working with &quot;radical cartography&quot;&mdash;a practice that uses maps and mapping to promote social change, and that is part of a cultural movement that links art, geography, and activism. The participating artists, architects, and collectives in the exhibition play with cartographic convention&mdash;geographic shapes, wayfinding symbols, and aerial views&mdash; in order to take on issues from globalization to garbage.<br />
  While mapping in art practice has expanded into technological and performative realms, An Atlas focuses on a traditional aspect of the map as a work-on-paper, and, importantly, its function as a political agent. The latter is underscored by the mapmakers themselves who are committed to social justice within their own diverse practices.<br />
  Works include Ashley Hunt's intricate diagram of the social effects of the global prison-industrial complex; the Center for Urban Pedagogy's mapping of the people who make and manage the &quot;garbage machine&quot; in New York City; Jane Tsong's drawing of how nature and culture clash in Los Angeles' watershed; and Trevor Paglen and John Emerson's route map of CIA rendition flights. </p>

<p><em>BASEKAMP is an artist-group and non-commercial space, which has researched and co-developed interdisciplinary, self-organized art projects with other individuals and groups in various authorship-blurring configurations for the past decade. We use our Philadelphia space, along with temporary camps in other locations, as a home base to invite domestic and international collaborative groups in a joint experiment to develop new models of relations within overlapping art communities. The goal is to continue proposing collaboration as a practical and theoretical stance, and to participate in its evolution.</em></p>
