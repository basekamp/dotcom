<h2>Secret School 02: Statelessness at Basekamp, Philadelphia</h2>
<p>In conversation with Lin + Lam</p>
<p><strong>Friday, February 20, 2009 from 7-10PM</strong> <br />
  Basekamp<br />
  723 Chestnut Street<br />
  Philadelphia, PA 19106</p>
<img src="../images2/linlam_this-is-not-me.jpg" />
<p>Secret School invites you to a collaborative event with Lin + Lam to examine the geopolitical implications of statelessness. Reflecting on tightened US immigration policy and the closing of Guantanamo Bay in the next year, Lin + Lam explore the inability or refusal to claim belonging to a recognized state. Lin + Lam will lead a discussion arising from their recent projects "Even the Trees Would Leave" and "This Is Not Me."</p>
<p>Secret School will respond to the issues raised through Lin + Lam's projects, and the concurrent exhibit at Basekamp: An Atlas, an examination of radical cartography organized by artists Lize Mogel and Alexis Bhagat.</p>
<p>Secret School explores the importance of the hidden and invisible in the social identity of a community through a series of time-based events and collaborations. Ranging from the political to the personal, epic to the quotidian, unknown to unknowable, how do secrets function in the transfer and preservation of power? At a time in which oversaturation of readily available information already exceeds our capacity for adequate synthesis, how can the poetics of secrets cut through the logic of facts? When does the form of a secret supersede its content, and under what circumstances must information remain a secret? Secret School spans an indefinite number of sessions and range of spaces and extends from the aesthetic practice of building systems of social exchange.</p>

<em>BASEKAMP is an artist-group and non-commercial space, which has researched and co-developed interdisciplinary, self-organized art projects with other individuals and groups in various authorship-blurring configurations for the past decade. We use our Philadelphia space, along with temporary camps in other locations, as a home base to invite domestic and international collaborative groups in a joint experiment to develop new models of relations within overlapping art communities. The goal is to continue proposing collaboration as a practical and theoretical stance, and to participate in its evolution.</em>
