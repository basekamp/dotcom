<h2>(IN)Visible Networks</h2>
<p><strong>Event dates</strong> <br />
  Sept 1-7, 2008 </p>
<p>Hi everyone, this week Basekamp is part of an exhibition in the UK called <em><a href="#">(IN)Visible Networks</a></em>, in connection with the <a href="http://www.networksofdesign.co.uk/"><em>Networks of Design</em></a> conference where Basekamp is also part of a panel <em>Virtual Networks, Social Fabrics</em> (within the <em>Networks of People</em> strand of the conference). While there, Scott  will be on a residency at <a href="http://www.ires.org.uk">iRes Research in Network Art</a> to further develop the <em>Plausible Artworlds</em> initiative.  </p>
<p><strong>(IN)Visible Networks exhibition</strong> </p>
<p>Network art is made with reference to information and communication technologies, DIY hacker culture, political activism, systems and platforms, and it works to expose the conditions and creative possibilities of network culture. Artists sometimes work at the meta level and devise social sculptures: participative environments within which users and other artists contribute work, ideas or time. Sometimes artists produce code or art objects that can be re-mixed in a number of contexts. </p>
<p>Artists in this exhibition use ritual, sampling, real-time collaboration, the reading of texts, play, wikis, trans narratives, DIY installations and discussion to creatively and critically explore life in the network society.</p>
<p>Artists: Basekamp &amp; friends, Ruth Catlow &amp; Marc Garret (furtherfield.org), glorious ninth (Kate Southworth &amp; Patrick Simons), S&ouml;nke Hallman, Dominic Thomas </p>
<p>Curators: Kate Southworth, Magda Tyzlik-Carver </p>
<p><strong>Virtual Networks, Social Fabrics panel</strong> </p>
<p>This forum is a result of virtual collaboration between artists, researchers, curators and theorists based in Europe and United States. We propose to consider it as a nodal point realised through an encounter, a meeting point where the projects, Department of Reading and Plausible Artworlds, which run independently of each other, get together. This encounter deems to open various textures and tonalities within which to discuss the kinds of sociality possibly created within the projects. During the forum we will indicate the complex relations which exist between technological and social networks. </p>
<p>The Department of Reading (DoR) has been initiated in 2006 among a group of researchers from the Jan van Eyck Academie, Maastricht, and is an online-based project displayed in different spatial configurations. In order to expose the act of reading in its potentiality the DoR investigates, how the disposition of readers to interfere with text can be made public as well as a mode to open texts towards their textures. During the course of two years the DoR has applied several forms of readings, using such online facilities as Wiki and Skype. If thus one intention of the DoR is to collectivize the process of reading another is to further a practice of writing while reading. Therefore the DoR has developed a digital platform that supports this process and provides the conditions for its reading sessions. </p>
<p>Plausible Artworlds was started in 2006 by the Philadelphia-based collaborative group Basekamp and has since involved many groups and people from around the world in the planning and organisational phase of the project, using both virtual technologies and through on-site seminars. The project’s premise is that those networks known as artworlds are not just places where art gets seen and talked about, but are no less integral to art production than artists themselves – for art cannot be sustained outside some form of artworld. The project provides a platform for examining and accompanying the emergence of plural artistic environments in the context of ever growing numbers of art and art-related practices both requiring artworld settings different from those currently on offer. The project gives visibility to artists’ collectives’ experiments with alternative artworlds through a community web platform, email discussion list, and archive of selected projects exemplifying Plausible Artworlds. </p>

<p>This forum is a part of a research project New Models of Curating?, initiated by Magda Tyzlik-Carver, Research Assistant at iRes cluster at University College Falmouth.  The main task of the project is to consider if it is possible to recognise and distinguish curatorial activity which is the result of operating in the environment of Internet and within the structures of social web and its networked systems defined through the existing and emergent protocols. </p>
<p>Biographies<br />
Sönke Hallmann currently lives and works in Berlin. He studied German literature and philosophy at the University of Hamburg and has since then published about questions concerning new forms of community, the experience of language and contemporary conceptions of messianism. In 2006 Sönke Hallmann has initiated the Department of Reading.</p>
<p>Scott Rigby will be representing BASEKAMP, an artist-group and non-commercial space, which has researched and co-developed interdisciplinary, self-organized art projects with other individuals and groups in various authorship-blurring configurations for the past decade. Scott Rigby co-founded and continues to help organize Basekamp's collaborative projects, international residency program, and exhibition space in Philadelphia with a rotating group of artists. The resulting projects have appeared in non-art contexts, online, in artist-run spaces, and institutional venues. Rigby has co-written several essays, and frequently presents at international conferences on critical group practices.</p>
<p>Magda Tyzlik-Carver works as a research assistant in iRes at University College Falmouth. Her current research interests include collaboration, the common, community and networks in the network society. As part of her research in the field of new media curating titled New Models of Curating? she has organised a series of online debates with international collaborative groups, such as UNWETTER, C:cred and Basekamp. </p>
<p><strong>Networks of Design &gt; Networks of People</strong></p>
<p><em>Networks of Design</em><br />
responds to recent academic interest in the fields of design history, technology and the social sciences in the ‘networks’ of interactions that inform knowledge formation and design. Studying networks foregrounds infrastructure, negotiations, processes, strategies of interconnection, and the heterogeneous relationships between people and things. </p>

<p>The 'Networks of People' theme focuses on ‘people’ as individuals, collectives, organisations or communities who are connected by specific relationships, ideas, beliefs or goals. Networks of people, for instance, might share common values, knowledge and practices, or inhabit the same psychological, geographical, theoretical or social space. They enable the development of associations and encourage processes of connectivity (or dislocation) that can operate in a variety of ways, intimately or at a distance, within local contexts, and across national and international boundaries. </p>
<p>From a design perspective, there is evidence to suggest that the more open the network, the more possibilities exist for creative growth, further encouraged by cross-pollination between disciplines and wider access to information and the exchange of ideas. ‘Networks of people’ invites proposals that consider the workings, attributes and relations of individual (or collective) 'agency' that help define networks of design. Papers may consider, for example, professional design networks (groups or societies); informal or formal creative communities or collaborations; consumer groups and the networks involved in adaptation and use; global networks; or the networks that emerge from shared experiences, or understandings of, gender, sexuality or ‘race’.</p>
