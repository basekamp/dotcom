    <p class="blackbar">About the alt.SPACE Festival in Philadelphia</p>
    <p>&quot;alt.SPACE Festival&quot; in Philadelphia is a series of events which focus on alternative conceptions, research methods, and experimental approaches by artists to spatial networks within this city.</p>
    <p>All the events take place in different spaces within the city, proposing active and critical reflections on questions such as access, distribution, ownership and uses of these spaces.</p>
    <p>&quot;Spaces&quot; are broadly defined to include various systems within Philadelphia, such as it's privately owned public transit underground thoroughfares; the management and trading of it's local and imported water; it's communication and information networks (wifi and instant messaging); it's sound-scapes (radio and air spaces).</p>
    <p>alt.SPACE, Philadelphia is linked to the alt.SPACE Festival in London this summer, and will hold a 24 hour long conference between the two cities at the end of July. See the calendar for details about this and the preceding events in Philadelphia throughout the month of July.</p>
