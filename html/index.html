<h2>The Hegemonic Bar: <em>Another round</em></h2>
<img src="images2/la-hegemonic-bar-est-basekamp-jul-3.jpg" alt="la hegemonic bar est basekamp jul 3" width="205" height="300" style="float: right; padding: 0 0 1em 1em;" /><h3>Event #2: Riot conditions</h3>
<h4>Friday July 3rd, 6-8pm<br />
  FREE and open to the public.</h4>
<p><strong>Basekamp space</strong><br />
  723 Chestnut Street, 2nd floor<br />
  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19106 usa</p>
<p>First enacted in 1999, The Hegemonic Bar is a social experiment and drinking game about class and money.</p>
<p>Hegemony refers to the strategies used by dominant powers to ensure the active complicity of the dominated in their own domination, by making any other option appear "out of the question", but in so doing enables alternatives to develop not in "response" but through previously unimagined countervailing forces.</p>
<p>The Hegemonic Bar is a theatrical set and fully working bar, split into 3 separate rooms to reflect a generic 3 class system of lower, middle, and upper. As individuals enter the door, they are given random amounts of fake money to spend at the bars or use as they wish.</p>
<p>In the July 3rd version of the installation, the gallery will be under riot conditions. With overturned cars and scattered (fake) bricks for throwing, the Basekamp reenacts some of the conditions of May '68, the Seattle protests of '99, and the current protests in Tehran.</p>

<p><strong>The Public School, Philly</strong><br />
  Starting this Summer, Basekamp will be helping to organize the Philadelphia branch of <a href="http://thepublicschool.org">The Public School</a>. For two months after opening night, The Hegemonic Bar will be available for meetings and proposals for classes.  As part of this process, we're also collecting books and texts on cultural hegemony, which will be made available in the bars. Suggestions for texts, ideas for meetings, and proposals for classes are welcome! <br />
  Please send to: <a href="mailto:projects@basekamp.com">projects[at]basekamp[dot]com</a></p>
<p>See you there!</p>

  PS, Here's some info about the first version of The Hegemonic Bar in 1999:<br />

<p>--<br />
  Basekamp is an artist-group and non-commercial space, which has researched and co-developed interdisciplinary, self-organized art projects with other individuals and groups in various authorship-blurring configurations for the past decade. We use our Philadelphia space, along with temporary camps in other locations, as a home base to invite domestic and international collaborative groups in a joint experiment to develop new models of relations within overlapping art communities. The goal is to continue proposing collaboration as a practical and theoretical stance, and to participate in its evolution.<br />
