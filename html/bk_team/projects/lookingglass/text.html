  Basekamp &amp; friends <br />
  Scott Rigby &amp; David Dempewolf<br />
  May 13-July 27, 2001. ICA Philadelphia </p>
  <p>Through 
      the Pedagogical Looking Glass was commissioned as part of the sight/site exhibition 
      held at the ICA in the spring of 2001. This exhibition addressed the ways 
      in which a work of art's meaning and reception is altered when placed within 
      new and different contexts. </p>
  <p>The 
    commissioned project was a life-size facsimile of Marcel Duchamp's door from 
    Etant Donnes. It consisted of two inkjet prints mounted on a rigid cut-out 
    of the door. Replacing the eyeholes of Etant Donnes was a projecting library 
    filing drawer, covered with a corresponding inkjet image of Duchamp's original 
    piece. Within the drawer was a stereoscopic three-dimensional view of the 
    interior tableau of Etant Donnes, which the viewer could see through two holes 
    in the face of the drawer. Filed at the back of the drawer were eight transparent 
    plexiglass cards. Each card bore the name of a writer and a corresponding 
    image summarizing their conception of Etant Donnes in a critical text. Visitors 
    were encouraged to choose a card and place it in a slot in front of the tableau 
    image. When looking through the eyeholes, the image on the card was stereoscopically 
    superimposed on Duchamp's work. Two feet from the door was a chair and a table; 
    on the table was a spiral bound book of photocopied essays in the form of 
    an academic bulk pack. Reprinted inside the pack was each of the critical 
    texts represented on the plexiglass cards. Visitors were permitted to sit 
    at the desk and leaf through the texts at their leisure. </p>
  <p>The 
    work was intended to visually illustrate how critical texts provide audiences 
    with critical and informative lenses to aid interpretation of the artist's 
    work. These critical approaches to the work carry the ideas, ideologies and 
    biases that were in circulation at the time that the texts were written. By 
    providing a multitude of critical voices, the work was intended to create 
    a clamor of conflicting voices that could cancel one another out, leaving 
    the viewer alone with Duchamp's Etant Donnes to experience it anew. The viewer 
    is then able to examine a disturbing image on its own terms, without a layer 
    of preconstructed critical interpretation. </p>
