<h4>Project description</h4>
<p><strong>Hegemonic Bar</strong> <br />
members of basekamp &amp; friends<br />
1999, Base Kamp gallery</p>
<p>The exhibition was named after, and based on, neo-Gramscian hegemony theory. Using this as a departure point, the Base Kamp created the Hegemonic Bar, with the consumption of alcohol as representative of class struggle. </p>
<p>Played like a three-dimensional game of life, the Hegemonic Bar was an interactive installation along with instructions, rules, alcohol, &amp; many people.</p>
<p>The structure consisted of three platforms signifying class stratification into lower, middle and upper classes. This was accomplished through a variety of visual and auditory metaphors. The platforms increased in elevation as they decreased in square footage, each color-coded with its appropriate decor, music, drink, and price. The lower bar was designated by country and hard rock music, pretzels and beer; the middle bar featured soft rock music, cheese and wine; and the upper bar was a symphony of classical music, martinis and Godiva. </p>
<p>The ability of guests to partcipate in each of the bars was determined by a random amount of phoney money distributed at the door. The majority of people were &#8216;classed&#8217; as either middle or lower income, while fewer guests received enough money to frequent the upperclass bar.</p>
<p>As the night wore on, the consumption of alcohol lessened the inhibitions of the partcipants. This helped to foster a more playful and creative approach to stereotypical class roles and manifest the Saturnalian role reversal sought by the installation. </p>
