  <h4>Project description </h4>
  <p><b>Failed Attempt At Shameless Self Promotion</b><br />
  Scott Rigby, David Dempewolf & Justin Matherly<br />
1999. Arcadia University Gallery</p>
  <p>The 
    activity of this project involved the participation of both direct and indirect 
    collaborators. Myself and several other Base Kamp artists agreed to perform 
    an activity together, which would find it's final form through the suggestion 
    of one of our indirect collaborators. These latter unwitting participants 
    were a number of older artists with established carers, who we approached 
    unsolicited. </p>
  <p>Our 
    goal was to deal with the historical stereotype of an older, successful artist 
    who helps to put a younger artist on the map by taking them under wing -- 
    often through work togetther, and specifically through collaboration as 'equals'. 
    The various levels of career development along with the monetary value of 
    artworks is a underlying consideration & often a detourant from collaboration 
    between otherwise potentially compatible artists. </p>
  <p>Our 
    procedure was simple. We would seek out artists who fit the above description, 
    ask them to participate in a base kamp advertisement by giving their 'thumbs-up' 
    with us on film, and wait for one of them to help determine the form al presentation 
    of the project through a suggestion. This would mean that, beyond merely agreeing 
    to follow our instructions, they would in fact have 'collaborated' with us 
    -- in the sense that they would co-conceptualize part of the project, whether 
    they intended to do so or not. </p>
  <p>A 
    possible formal presentation of this activity was (finally) suggested by Sol 
    LeWitt, and we formatted the project accordingly. In response to his reccomendation 
    that we check out Lucy Lippard's Six Years, our three pages were made to conform 
    stylistically to the range of work represented in the book. We used this documentary-style 
    format to our advantage, re-editing a script that at first resembles the often 
    dry verbage of conceptual art into a narrative of our various exploits - filtered 
    through our own ideosyncracies, and purposeful misinterpretation.</p>
