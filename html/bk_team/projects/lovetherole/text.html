  <p>Love 
    The Role was an interactive video installation that explored the nature of 
    artist stereotypes and the ways in which they are perpetuated and exacerbated 
    by popular culture. </p>
  <p>We 
    began work on this project by watching popular films in an effort to isolate 
    specific moments that provide &quot;insight&quot; into what it means to be 
    an artist. The leading actors we looked to as examples were Charlton Heston, 
    Isabel Adjani, Leonardo Dicaprio, Nick Nolte and Rosanna Arquette, and Kirk 
    Douglas. </p>
  <p>This 
    installation consisted of two color monitors which were placed side by side. 
    Both monitors were synchronized; one screen played the original clips from 
    movies that portray ‘Hollywood’ depictions and expectations of artists, while 
    the other screen displayed the Base Kamp members, acting out the same 'Hollywood' 
    scenes in full costume and make-up. </p>
  <p>These 
    were shown along with the low-end digitally reproduced sets and props used 
    in the making of the Base Kamp versions, and with amazon.com online reviews 
    of the original films labeling each set. </p>
  <p>Across 
    the gallery, two black and white monitors sat side by side facing the 'Lust 
    for Life' set. The monitor on left played a clip from the 1956 film over and 
    over, in which the tortured Van Gogh contemplates suicide, scribbles out a 
    desperate note, and finally shoots himself in the stomach. Gallery visitors 
    were invited to interact with the set, while a surveillance camera aimed at 
    the scene enabled them to view themselves on the right-side monitor. Watching 
    themselves on-screen in the exact same situation as Kirk Douglas on the next 
    monitor, the viewer can decide to follow his lead, or act out their own artistic 
    fantasies. </p>
