      <h4>Event #1 </h4>
      <p>Initiated by Basekamp  &amp; Lars Fischer<br />
Saturday, November 19th, 2005. <br />
starts at 2pm<br />
at Andrew Kreps Gallery, NEW LOCATION: <br />
558 W 21st St, New York, NY 10011<font size="-2"><br />
</font><br />
Participants were invited to respond to the question &quot;how much room is there in the (art) world for redundancy?&quot; as part of the first event in a series about cultural co-production.<br />
          <br />
&quot;Have you noticed others producing work similar to yours? Are they imitating your style, or are you repeating others work without knowing it? Who did it first? Who did it best? Why is similarity so bothersome?&quot;<br />
          <br />
Featured participants held a productive forum to discuss the degree of similarity allowable, and amount of competition necessary in the field of cultural production; Whether opportunities for shared values and interests can overlap or merge effectively; How awareness and combination of similar practices may be pointing toward alternate forms of cultural practice in the 21st century. <br />
        <br />
The aim of this forum was to facilitate discussion along these lines, and collectively produce a prototype document that expresses current thinking on this topic by practitioners in the field. <em>Discussion panels </em>designed by BASEKAMP were used as a notational and catalytic device to connect ideas and experiences that came up at the event, allowing participants to build a rough draft for the next event in the series. <br />
