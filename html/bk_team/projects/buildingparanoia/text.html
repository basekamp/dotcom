  <p><strong>Building Paranoia</strong><br />
  Basekamp &amp; friends <br />
  Justin Matherly, David Dempewolf, &amp; Scott Rigby<br />
    2001, Project Room, Philadelphia</font></p>
  <p>This 
    exhibition is an example of a show within a show. The Base Kamp artists produced 
    an installation that confronted meaningful and potentially volatile content 
    through the technique of dead-pan dissimulation. </font></p>
  <p>The 
    artists wanted to comment on a situation of poor city planning. The African 
    American Museum of Philadelphia was erected during the bicentennial amidst 
    a flurry of construction that was meant to attract visitors in the summer 
    of '76. Much to the chagrin of the museum’s directors, the new building was 
    allotted the space right next to the Philadelphia police headquarters. In 
    1997, city planners and local government decided that the empty lot across 
    the street would be the ideal site to construct a Federal Detention Center. </font></p>
  <p>Building 
    Paranoia confronted gallery-goers with tensions between a staged and actual 
    exhibit. </font></p>
  <p>Our 
    staged exhibition was a video which consisted of a gallery installation that 
    presented images of the views from the inside of the African American Museum's 
    North and South windows. Police Headquarters is prominently in view from the 
    museum's large northern plate glass window, while the Federal Detention Center 
    floods the opposite window. In the video, gallery visitors interact with one 
    another paying little attention to the images on the walls that surround them. 
    We created the video from footage we gathered by inviting the Philadelphia 
    art community to attend a party in the Project room a week before the actual 
    Building Paranoia opening. The gallery was painted green, and three cameras 
    were set up to record the party-goers' every move. Through standard green-screen 
    technology, the video appered to document our staged exhibition as if it had 
    actually taken place. </font></p>
  <p>The 
    actual show was a documentary style narrative about our collaborative production 
    of the aforementioned staged exhibition. There was some suspension of disbelief 
    required of visitors, but also a feeling that they had missed a recent show. 
    The running narrative touched on the difficulty of making effective social 
    statements with art, questioned our own roles in relation to racial inequality, 
    and addressed that we were presenting messages to an audience that felt they 
    were already adequately aware of this situation. </font></p>
  <p>Emphasizing 
    the documentation of our own collaborative creation of 'an exhibition' (tempered 
    with humor) was our solution to approaching certain structural events without 
    either being too didactic or too defeatist.</font></p>
