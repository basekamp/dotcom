  <p><font color="#FF0000" size="+1">A Tasty Treat</font><br />
    <font color="#FF0000">By James Westcott<br />
    Zing Magazine 2002</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">According to the work &quot;Border NY Times 01-02&quot; 
    at Cuchifritos gallery in Essex Street Market, the word &quot;Border&quot; 
    appeared in New York Times headlines 124 times between January 2001 and September 
    2002. The artist/compiler Burel simply printed out all the stories and bound 
    them together in a book. Almost every article is about fighting over borders, 
    strengthening borders, or panicking at the porousness of borders.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">Essex Street Market, an indoor shopping centre on the 
    shabby Lower East Side, is not the kind of place you would expect to find 
    an art gallery. But this is precisely the point. Cuchifritos, a tiny triangular 
    space tucked away in the southern corner of the market, was created in August 
    2001 by the Artist&#8217;s Alliance Incorporated. They persuaded the New York 
    City Economic Development Corporation, who owns the market, to give them $12,000 
    to renovate the space. The current exhibition, in which &quot;Border&#8230;&quot; 
    appears, is called Curatorial Market. It is the culmination of the Cuchifritos 
    project to dissolve boundaries between art and the market (literally, since 
    the exhibition spills out into the market itself) and between Artists and 
    the Market (for the exhibition, curators were invited to contribute as artists, 
    and artists were asked to curate). Cuchifritos means something like a fried 
    tasty treat.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">Essex Street Market is an air-conditioned retreat from 
    the street. Inside, there is a gentle happy hum of people. The market is lego-bright: 
    shiny banners hang from the ceiling, the floor is blue; there are yellow pipes, 
    red garbage cans, the green plastic fur of fake grass. There are electronics 
    and clothes stores; you can get any part of any animal from Luis the butcher; 
    there is a stall with 1970s kitsch objects and ethnic statues, with a sign 
    saying &quot;NO PHOTOGRAPHS&quot;. Among the shoppers, a man is asleep draped 
    over a table, a few old men gather around a television, people argue and joke; 
    a man is dancing by himself. Beneath his feet is a question stuck to the ground 
    in vinyl, translated into three languages: &quot;What is it that you need 
    or could make the market more ideal for you?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">The question is posed by the artists Gavin Wade and 
    Scott Rigby, who are determined to make art useful, to make it solve problems. 
    A cardboard structure sits in an empty stall, acting both as a sculptural 
    interpretation of the produce boxes piled behind the counters everywhere and 
    as a plinth upon which to place their pamphlet &quot;An Ideal Art For the 
    Market&quot;. In it they ask two further questions, in five languages: &quot;Ideally, 
    how do you imagine art could be made of use to you?&quot; and &quot;What is 
    your ideal relationship or connection to others in the market?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">Luis Rodriguez, the owner of Luis Meat Market, says 
    he isn&#8217;t the kind of person who goes to galleries &#8211; not even Cuchifritos. 
    But he was happy to answer Wade and Rigby&#8217;s questions. &quot;Art is 
    personal,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It has to be something that a person likes 
    and enjoys, and somehow helps them to relax, and also I think that it could 
    help to develop more business, for example if people see a work of art they 
    become content, and when people are happy they have the tendency to spend 
    more. For that reason I think that art is useful.&quot; Rodriguez may be indifferent 
    towards Cuchifritos but he understands the Curatorial Market idea perfectly: 
    allowing art and commerce to embrace. He also insists that music should be 
    piped into the market, to pacify people and get them to buy more. &quot;This 
    is the kind of music they should play &#8211; or jazz,&quot; he says, smiling, 
    and leaning back from the counter to turn up the radio.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">Although he is not against the gallery, Rodriguez doesn&#8217;t 
    understand why it is in the market. He asks me to explain the message behind 
    it, when I was hoping he would explain it to me. I say something about making 
    art accessible and bringing different kinds of people together. His deeply 
    wrinkled, indented face scrunches up a little more. &quot;There&#8217;s a 
    big cultural difference between the people who come to the gallery and the 
    housewives who come here to shop,&quot; he says. &quot;The people who go to 
    the gallery are totally different, more educated.&quot; Those who come here 
    for the gallery don&#8217;t usually shop, and those who come here to shop 
    don&#8217;t usually go the gallery, he explains. &quot;So maybe the gallery 
    isn&#8217;t really attracting either group of people in any great numbers.&quot; 
    Most shoppers seem to ignore Cuchifritos, but very occasionally someone stands 
    transfixed by a photograph; one women exclaims &quot;I love that idea!&quot; 
    And sometimes the &quot;educated&quot; people buy a nectarine or a peach from 
    Farm Foods. Cuchifritos facilitates slippage between the categories of people 
    in Essex Street Market through chance conversations and the surprise &#8211; 
    even the affront &#8211; of finding art here. The kind of gentrification which 
    Cuchifritos represents is more inclusive and inspiring than the standard process.<br />
    </font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">Rodriguez has mixed feelings about gentrification: 
    he used to have a shop on the Lower East Side but was forced out when the 
    rent went up from $500 to $4000 overnight. &quot;All of a sudden a lot of 
    boutiques started opening up and the area became&#8230;&quot; he pauses, shrugs, 
    &quot;&#8230;hip.&quot; On the other hand, he says the Lower East Side has 
    improved dramatically in his lifetime, and Essex Street Market is indicative 
    of the economic growth. &quot;I am lucky to be in this market because everywhere 
    else around here the rent is astronomical. I am very happy here. I hope nobody 
    takes this market away from us.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">Although it is a symptom of gentrification, the Cuchifritos 
    phenomenon is not simply a case of the East Village extending its tentacles 
    of trendiness down to the Lower East Side, infiltrating and perhaps romanticizing 
    an audience of cool uncultivated multiculturals. To think so would be snobbery 
    dressed up as anti-snobbery: many of the market-goers and stall-owners are 
    genuinely interested in art &#8211; why shouldn&#8217;t they be? &#8211; and 
    have contributed to the last three exhibitions here. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">For the August exhibition, &quot;Local&quot;, curatorship 
    was democratized: everyone who works in the market was asked to bring in something 
    from their home which they considered to be art. It could be something they 
    had made themselves or something that had been made for them, something they 
    found&#8230; anything they considered to be of artistic value. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">Carmen Salvadore, who has run Three Brother&#8217;s 
    Garments for twelve years, made a doll out of toilet paper for &quot;Local&quot;. 
    &quot;I am very grateful for the gallery coming here,&quot; she says, &quot;because 
    I am a creative person and nobody would recognize that before. I don&#8217;t 
    go to other galleries in the city, I have to admit. Cuchifritos is the only 
    gallery I go to.&quot; Carmen says that Cuchifritos brings &quot;totally different&quot; 
    people to the market and that it has &quot;opened the door&quot; for her to 
    meet new people. She beckons me over to see Wade and Rigby&#8217;s geodesic 
    cardboard structure, before I can explain that I&#8217;ve already seen it. 
    But she sees something I didn&#8217;t see: the masking tape is coming away 
    at the side and the shape is bursting open. Carmen looks worried, strokes 
    the wound in the sculpture and pushes it further back into the empty stall 
    to protect it from passing people.<br />
    <br />

    <br />
    Paul Clay, the director of the Artist&#8217;s Alliance Incorporated (AAI) 
    and the man who pitched the idea of Cuchifritos, is ecstatic to have given 
    art to the people in the market as a part of their daily experience. &quot;A 
    totally unexpected thing which came out of the &#8216;Local&#8217; project 
    was the number of people who said that they do make art, but they just don&#8217;t 
    have enough time to do it as much as they would like to, if at all. I thought 
    that was both amazing and tragic &#8211; an example of how work just eats 
    away at life and closes so many opportunities.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">These opportunities are something the AAI wants to 
    give back, not only through Cuchifritos. The AAI formed in 1998 and is based 
    in a derelict school building on Suffolk Street, two blocks behind the market. 
    It is now the largest long-term studio program in Manhattan, with sixty-five 
    artists in residence. As well as a way to organise and galvanise its members, 
    the AAI has always been focussed on disseminating art into the community. 
    In the summer the AAI holds an outdoor event called SPLASH! where children 
    paint anything they want on a huge canvas. &quot;It&#8217;s a lot of fun,&quot; 
    says Clay, &quot;and with Cuchifritos we&#8217;re giving a little taste of 
    art for people in the market.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">But Clay is cautious about the issue of gentrification 
    and the imposition, the assumptions and the awkward questions of class and 
    snobbery it raises, especially in the realm of art: &quot;At first we weren't 
    even sure if we should pitch the idea [to the EDC], because we didn&#8217;t 
    want to go in there and gentrify the market. Then a nice lounge and restaurant 
    took up residency at the north end of the building. At that point we felt 
    the addition of our space wasn't a problem in comparison.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">The AAI has had bitter experience of gentrification, 
    having nearly been evicted from their studios. The city wanted to sell the 
    building and the organization which manages the building also wanted them 
    out. &quot;But we&#8217;re now working with the city and with theater groups 
    and resident organizations to set up an entirely new not-for-profit to manage 
    the maintenance of the building and to raise funds for capital improvement. 
    It will take on the bricks and mortar stuff, leaving AAI free to run the studio 
    program and other activities.&quot; The building needs millions of dollars 
    worth of renovations: for a visitor its dank decay may be charming but to 
    work there must be difficult. &quot;Rents are subsidized to make affordable 
    workspace,&quot; Clay explains, &quot;but the work that goes into defending 
    the place and sustaining it is phenomenal.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">Clay is still optimistic about gentrification: &quot;The 
    critical thing New York needs right now is neighborhood development strategies. 
    No one is going to stop gentrification, but the engine of development can 
    be harnessed to benefit the local people in a community, by diffusing profit 
    into the neighborhood, rather than funneling it all to outsiders at the top 
    and forcing local people out.&quot; <br />
    <br />
    *<br />
    <br />
    Despite its populist ideals, the Curatorial Market raises complex, insider 
    issues about the relationship between artist and curator. &quot;These two 
    disciplines are beginning to mix and merge in ways that some people find appalling 
    and others see as a powerful new development in the history of art making,&quot; 
    Clay explains. However, abandoning the idea of the autonomous piece of art 
    can be problematic. &quot;Having art that relates very strongly to the market 
    context can fuck up the commodification process in an interesting way. It 
    both points it up as an object to consume, and at the same time makes it harder 
    to effectively remove from its context in order to be sold. There is a danger 
    that when curators have too strong an over-arching vision that the artists&#8217; 
    works can end up simply as building blocks used to construct the curator&#8217;s 
    point. On the other hand if the curator&#8217;s point is weak then the works 
    can get stranded totally out of context.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">Per H&uuml;ttner, the director of Curatorial Market, 
    dodged these problems simply by opening up the curatorial process. A photographer 
    and video artist as well as a curator, he believes in a symbiotic relationship 
    between art, curator, and context. &quot;Curating is very much connected to 
    art in general,&quot; he says. &quot;It&#8217;s a means of expressing myself 
    just as creatively as I do in art. I don&#8217;t see much difference between 
    the two.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">H&uuml;ttner took his first &quot;stumbling steps&quot; 
    in curating in a gallery in Stockholm, called Konstakuten, which he opened 
    with three colleagues in 1995. Curating was necessary both as a way of erasing 
    traditional boundaries in the gallery and as a means of &quot;self preservation&quot;: 
    &quot;We weren&#8217;t interested in just showing art to our mates,&quot; 
    says H&uuml;ttner. &quot;Without a stimulating environment and dynamic peer 
    group any artist, however talented and motivated, will eventually fall silent. 
    This either means that the artist stops developing or simply stops working 
    altogether.&quot; Above all, artists need a challenging community for support 
    and inspiration. &quot;That&#8217;s why I picked up curating, because it offered 
    me tools to grow as an artist and human being &#8211; through meeting people.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">&quot;When I first started this project my idea was 
    to bring over my favorite people in the art world. But when I saw the gallery 
    I realized that the context of it was something that needed to be addressed.&quot; 
    </font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">The work that most beautifully addresses the context 
    of trade is the sound installation by Tank magazine arts editor Claire Canning, 
    Andy Cox (the former guitarist in the Beat and the Fine Young Cannibals) and 
    producer Richard Allalouf. It is an eavesdropping recording of bleeps at a 
    supermarket checkout set against the muted chattering of parents packing their 
    shopping and the excited giggling of their children. Occasionally the notes 
    of the bleeps are made to echo and soar; all the while there is a strange, 
    barely audible rumbling &#8211; the sound of process, of things working.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">Like Wade and Rigby, H&uuml;ttner is for immediacy 
    and usefulness in art. &quot;Art is by default, in the western context, useless. 
    The fact that no one can walk into the Met and use the Melanesian masks for 
    a private ritual in the museum proves that point. It&#8217;s all about context.&quot; 
    H&uuml;ttner wishes that the idea of the autonomous work of art was obsolete. 
    However: &quot;The network between collectors, museums and traditional curators 
    does nothing to challenge the social and monetary systems within the art world.&quot; 
    For them to work against the networks by undermining the self-sufficiency 
    of the art work &quot;would be like biting the hand that feeds them. But then 
    again anyone who wants to challenge and change things will ultimately become 
    that renegade canine that bites his owner.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">In the Curatorial Market, H&uuml;ttner insists that 
    he doesn&#8217;t have an agenda, just some questions: &quot;To what degree 
    is art about ideas and to what degree is it about objects? How is commodification 
    and the fetishization of commodities reflected in contemporary art? Was art 
    a forerunner of this fetishism? What benefits and pitfalls are there for contemporary 
    art when art is no longer object based?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">H&uuml;ttner acknowledges that, since all the works 
    were chosen with the market in mind, should the Curatorial Market go on tour, 
    it would have to change completely. But it is this transience, this uniqueness 
    that is the attraction of the project. &quot;It was such a nice atmosphere 
    setting up the exhibition in the market,&quot; H&uuml;ttner says. &quot;A 
    gallery or a museum can be quite hostile. Working in the market I felt that 
    every day there were magical meetings between people, who would not normally 
    interact &#8211; because of the social void which is created in the process 
    of gentrification. The art in Cuchifritos reaches out to the people who are 
    not normally exposed to it, and we have the possibility of experiencing a 
    social context that we wouldn&#8217;t normally be able to take part in. As 
    soon as the process of gentrification stops and everyone &#8211; on both sides 
    &#8211; gets stuck in their ways, this exchange will wither and die. So, yes, 
    I think the gallery does speed up the process of gentrification, but at the 
    same time it also creates opportunities within this process that are a lot 
    more valuable than we could ever imagine.&quot;</font></p>
