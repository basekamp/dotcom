<h4>Project description </h4>
<p>In this exhibition, the artist/re-presenters David Dempewolf and Scott Rigby 
      will assemble an exhibition to examine the problematics and generative potentials 
    within artist curated projects.</p>
<p>When one 
    looks closely, what is revealed or concealed about the artist/curators' location 
    in geography, time, and subjective identity positioning, when they re-present 
    the work of their peers? </p>
  <p>The artists 
    organizing this exhibition are re-presenting artists who re-present artists. 
    In what way does this exhibition&#8217;s circularity of re-presentation highlight 
    the issues of location and positioning? In this exhibition, as well as within 
    the projects that are to be selected; artists are utilized for their roles 
    as nodes within a seemingly infinite social field of physical and mnemonic 
    networks. Participants are asked not only to provide examples of their curatorial 
    projects, but also to make recommendations of other artist/curated exhibitions 
    from their own memories. This process of linking artists expands exponentially, 
    creating cyborg search engines that present findings or hits, which are linked 
    within the tissue of a living network of disparate artistic communities.</p>
  <p>We are asking the participating artist/curators 
    to see their curatorial strategies as experiments within the social field 
    of discursive and agonistic relationships. For this permutation of the exhibition, 
    the participants&#8217; contributions will be re-presented in the form of 
    displays within a science fair-like setting. This format intends to examine 
    a specific practice in art through the middle-school equivalent of a science 
    convention - where practitioners share strategies, developments, and distribute 
    information within a community of their immediate peers.</p>
