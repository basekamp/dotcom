  <h4>Questionnaire</h4>
  <p class="style2">Please 
    fill out the Questionnaire form below. Because we are asking artists to see 
    their curatorial strategies as experiments, we plan to present this information 
    in the form of a science fair. This will examine a specific practice in art 
    through the middle-school equivalent of a science convention - where practitioners 
    share strategies, developments, and distribute information within a community 
    of their immediate peers.</p>
  <p class="style2"><strong>When responding 
    to us, these might be helpful ideas to think about:</strong><br />
    Since professional competition is the dominant model within the artworld, 
    how do you find an individual place within emerging collectivity?<br />
    What is your relationship to others in the network created by your curatorial 
    project? (Examples of roles: Rule maker, conceptual engineer, organizer, modifier, 
    exhibition designer, participant, solvent, insider / outsider, name on a list, 
    more than one or all of these, or no preference?)</p>
  <p class="style2"><strong>Connect 
    The Dots: Questionnaire Form</strong><br />
    Please describe your exhibition by using the scientific method (below):</p>
  <p class="style2"><strong>1. 
    Problem or Question. </strong><br />
    In the planning for one of your past exhibitions, please identify a problem 
    or question you wanted to explore, that you then investigated through the 
    use empirical observation and then documented in the form of the final exhibition 
    or journal. <br />
    <strong>2. Hypothesis. </strong><br />
    Try to articulate your intentions or strategies you adopted employed for re-presenting 
    the work produced by your peers. Also include the original press release or 
    exhibition statement if available.<br />
    <strong>3. Materials &amp; Resources</strong>. <br />
    List what was needed for the exhibition to take place; e.g. materials, equipment, 
    grants, private support or personal financing, venue opportunities, volunteers, 
    help or advice from colleagues, artists fulfilling specific needs or services 
    within the exhibition.<br />
    <strong>4. Procedure.</strong> <br />
    Your procedure was your plan of action or a list of what you did. Describe 
    the events that took place throughout the planning, experimentation, and making 
    of the exhibition. <br />
    <strong>5. Data.</strong> <br />
    This is the basic information about the exhibition, such as its title, dates 
    and location, names of co-curators, artists involved, support staff, special 
    thanks, and any other credits or relevant information.<br />
    <strong>6. Results. </strong><br />
    Show what happened - the observations critical and documentation you or your 
    peers have made . Provide a visual or textual description of the final exhibition 
    (objects or events). Please include any critical reception of the exhibition 
    (reviews, articles).<br />
    <strong>7. Conclusions.</strong> <br />
    Tell what you learned. Answer your original question and state whether your 
    hypothesis was reflected in the final results, and if this illuminated anything 
    new or valuable in your hypothesis.</p>
