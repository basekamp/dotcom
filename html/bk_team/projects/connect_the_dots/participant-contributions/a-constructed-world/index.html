    A Constructed World - Jacqueline Riva &amp; Geoff Lowe (Turin)</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FF6600">Problem</font></strong><br />
    In the time leading up to his death Kurt Cobain was critical of both the music 
    scene and system and his own withering efforts to tell-the-truth within it. 
    What does it mean to be authentic in a market-driven world? Can artists continue 
    to commit themselves to what they believe to be true?</p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FF6600">Hypothesis</font></strong><br />
    ACW projects stay open and see what happens. We don&#8217;t know what will 
    happen when we bring artists together and we don&#8217;t know what the outcomes 
    and audience reaction will be.<br />
    The &#8216;space&#8217; for this exhibition and five more editions is our 
    apartment in Turin, Italy. There are many commercial galleries and museums 
    in Turin but not a more intimate, less formal interface (like the artist run 
    spaces in Melbourne or New York). We want to create a more informal interface 
    with an audience here in Turin.<br />
    In projects where we invite other artists to participate, like this show, 
    we have often met before and already realized that we had the desire to work 
    together. We knew most of the artists and Charlotte had met the other artists 
    who were invited. </p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FF6600">Materials &amp; Resources</font></strong><br />
    We aim to make low-fi &#8211; low-budget high-energy projects. Our budget 
    extends to postage and freight, that&#8217;s about it. For A level of trust 
    we used our own domestic equipment for sound and video. We work with like-minded 
    people in a situation where we can do something quickly and impulsively with 
    limited funds and include artists who make fantastic work. Rather than waiting 
    for bureaucratic institutions to put artists in shows we are able to include 
    artists from other countries quite spontaneously. </p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FF6600">Procedure</font></strong><br />
    What we see as resources are things like not-knowing and embarrassment. <br />
    Previous contacts, shared resources, inviting people who don&#8217;t-know 
    in an impulsive, informal setting. The performance, by Viliani and Robecchi, 
    was initiated by them, both art critics, not artists. It was decided that 
    ACW would create the context for their performance given that they had not 
    performed before.<br />
    Everything, artists bios, images and other material was organized directly 
    through the artists and not through any representative galleries. </p>

    The space: More Fools in Town<br />
    via Guastalla 19<br />

    aconstructedworld@libero.it<br />
    Exhibition title: A level of trust. After Kurt Cobain.<br />
    Dates: 21 May &#8211; 5 June 2004<br />
    Coordinated by: A Constructed World, artists Jacqueline Riva + Geoff Lowe 
    and curator Charlotte Laubard<br />
    The artists: Ester Partegas, New York, vedovamazzei, Milan, Mungo Thomson, 
    Los Angeles, Arnaud Maguet, Nice, Elizabeth Newman, Melbourne, Piero Golia, 
    Naples, Blair Trethowan, Melbourne, Olav Westphalen, New York.<br />
    Performance: Untitled, Andrea Viliani and Michele Robecchi.(both curator/critic)<br />
    Email conversation: Laubard facilitated an email conversation related to the 
    show, &#8216;What does it mean to be an &#8216;authentic&#8217; artist now-a-days?&#8217; 
    <br />
    Conversation participants from the exhibition: Elizabeth Newman, Blair Trethowan 
    Mungo Thomson, Laubard and ACW. Others included curator/critic Alessandro 
    Rabottini, Milan, and gallerists Jarrod Rawlins, Uplands Gallery Melbourne 
    and Hu Fang, Vitamin Creative Space, Guangzhou.</p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FF6600">Results</font></strong><br />
    We reached a large audience at the opening, about 100 people, and even though 
    the space is just 4 ante-rooms in our upstairs apartment, numerous people 
    from Milan, Turin and Sydney approached us to show at More Fools in Town. 
    One man came with paintings in the back of his car and we looked at them in 
    the street. Some brought and sent us slides and others people emailed images.<br />
    There is dvd documentation of the performance by Viliani and Robecchi and 
    photographic documentation of the works. The exhibition was reviewed in Torino 
    Sette, a weekly arts and entertainment newspaper, at Exibart on the internet 
    and has subsequently been written about in Flash Art. We also received emails 
    from friends and acquaintances offering encouragement for the project.<br />
    Three works in the show sold to collectors which is important for this project 
    as the commission will fund the next edition of More Fools in Town, a show 
    called Fully Functional opening late September.</p>
  <p><strong><font color="#FF6600">Conclusions</font></strong><br />
    ACW values not-knowing as a shared space. We do not anticipate outcomes and 
    do not work in an empirical mode. Our projects use authenticity to build trust, 
    whether it&#8217;s possible to believe in trust or not. We allow absence to 
    exist in the project, for example Viliani and Robecchi hadn&#8217;t made a 
    performance before, nor did they rehearse. Just as the audience may be apprehensive 
    or embarrassed the gallerists and performers were unused to their roles and 
    unsure what would happen.</p>
