<p>The CTD Symposium is an extension of the Connect The Dots exhibition. A selection of participants from the exhibition, along with the co-organizers David Dempewolf and Scott Rigby, will each give 10-15 minute oral/video presentations of the their contribution to the project, with an informal discussion to follow. This event is intended to enable participants to interact more directly and independently, to share strategies and developments, and to distribute information within a community of peers. </p>

<p><strong>exhibition information </strong></p>
<p>Connect The Dots is an exhibition investigating models of connectivity created by artists who curate. The co-organizers David Dempewolf and Scott Rigby have enlisted the help of 60 international artists and groups to contribute their field research and findings to add to a collective knowledge base about an emerging practice.</p>
<p>The exhibition is intended to be a meeting of minds for co-generating a tangible appendix of strategies for artist curated projects. The participating artists examine their past and current curatorial work as experiments within a social field of vocational relationships. </p>
<p>Contributions were displayed within a science fair-like setting. This format re-presents a specific art practice through the middle-school equivalent of a science convention where practitioners share strategies, developments, and distribute information within a community of their immediate peers. This project will culminate in the creation of a printed journal that will help articulate a current set of specific practices, and serve as a list of possibilities for new work by emerging practitioners.</p>
