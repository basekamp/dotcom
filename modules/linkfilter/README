Link Filter - converts [l:URL text] tags

INSTALL
 
 1) Unzip the linkfilter.zip kit in the modules directory of your Drupal
    setup, usually sites/all/modules

 2) This will create:
     modules/linkfilter/
     modules/linkfilter/linkfilter.css
     modules/linkfilter/linkfilter.info
     modules/linkfilter/linkfilter.module
     modules/linkfilter/README
     modules/linkfilter/*.png and *.gif icon files

 3) As admin user, go to administer -> modules, and enable linkfilter module.

 4) Go to administer -> Input Formats, click on "configure" for Filtered
 HTML (and all other required input formats), and enable the "Link Filter".
 
 Now you can use [l:URL text] tags in all the nodes that are using the
 appropriate input formats.

 Click on Input Formats when editing a node for more help - there is a link
 to "Link Filter Tips" section on the filter tips page that provides
 more details and examples.

-----------------------------------------
The goal for this filter is to be somewhat like the URL filter included
with Drupal, with the additional requirement to be Drupal installation
directory independent as well as domain independent so that the URLs in
Drupal nodes don't have to be re-edited when a Drupal site is moved to a
different sub-directory or a different domain. Additionally, it allows
for link text to be specified for the URL, and it preserves the input
characters as much as possible, performing no or minimal HTML entity
conversions of the input characters.

-----------------------------------------
/**
 * "Link filter" Drupal module, replaces [l:URL text] input tags.
 *
 * [l:URL text] text filter for internal Drupal or external Web links.
 * "text" is optional, and can be multiple words. URL can be any URL -
 * an alias, or any Drupal path, or a non-Drupal path with full
 * http://URL notation.
 * This is converted to a HTML href tag, prefixed with:
 * 1) $base_root if the URL begins with a / character
 * 2) no prefix if the URL has a : in it, example: http: or ftp: etc
 * 3) converted with Drupal l() function in all other cases,
 *    for example recipe/boil-potatoes  or node/231
 *    In this case, the URL is considered to be a Drupal system path.
 * 
 * Appropriate class="linkfilter-<type>" tag will be added, from this list:
 * linkfilter-drupal, linkfilter-local, linkfilter-urlfull,
 * linkfilter-mailto, linkfilter-drupal-node-<node_type>
 * See the linkfilter.css file for examples and link icons available for use
 * with these classes.
 * 
 * [l:recipe/boil-potatoes link text]
 *    ==>
 * <a href="http://..../drupal-dir/recipe/boil-potatoes">link text</a>
 * 
 * For non-Drupal paths:
 * Space " " and right square bracket ] need to be escaped in URL and text.
 * in URL:  For space use %20. For right square bracket ] use %5D or &#93;
 * in text: For right square bracket ] use &#93;
 * Note that Drupal l() is not used because it munges special characters
 * and query tags like after the ? character in the URL.
 *
 * For Drupal paths:
 * As of version 0.7, uses Drupal l() function to create HTML for the
 * link. This will allow [l:node/281] to be changed to the alias, if any
 * for node/281.
 *
 * ---
 * syntax borrowed from wiki example: [http://www.example.com Example site]
 *
 * Added l: prefix to allow normal use of square brackets [ ] so that
 * only prefixed content gets transformed.
