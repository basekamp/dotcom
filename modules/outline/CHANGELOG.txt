# CHANGELOG.txt for the outline.module
######################################

# tag DRUPAL-6--0-0-ALPHA2 : 28th November 2008. 
# ==============================================

28th November 2008
==================
* (#295521) User specific books:
  The administrator can limit some books to some specified authors. Only nodes by those authors will be accepted in such books.

27th November 2008
==================
* Many bugfixes related to versioning.
  Regardless of the user permissions with regard to book outlining and outline settings,
  new versions of the node are properly saved, and versions can be deleted or reverted.

26th November 2008
==================
Big patch coming!
* (#295521) The permission "add content to books" can now be overruled on a per book basis.
  We can set which roles and which individual users are allowed to add content in each book.
  For this we created a new permission setting page for each book (see admin > Content management > Books > edit permissions).
  The setting affect the 'add child page' links and the node form. 
* (#331564) bugfix: "Call-time pass-by-reference has been deprecated;"

24th October 2008
==================
* A book cover has now two TOC_depth settings: one for the book cover itself, and one for all child pages.

23rd October 2008
==================
* (#315186) Import data from {book} when outline is enabled after book.module had been in use.
* Add proper default values in some fields in {outline_book} and {outline_node}.

30th September 2008
==================
* Fixed hook_uninstall(), deleting tables and variables.


20th August 2008
==================

* (#297257) Bugfix: editing nodes in different scenarios (whether they were previously outlined or not, etc.)


# tag DRUPAL-6--0-0-alpha1 : 15th August 2008. 
# ============================================

14th August 2008
================

* Fixed the form in the outline tab. The outline options set by this module can now be updated at the 'outline' tab.
* Fixed the import of the D5 data during the upgrade to D6. 
* Fix add_child url. (#256355)

13th August 2008
================

* Added the outline navigation block at the bottom of a node. This outline is overriding the similar book navigation block.
  Thus, we can use our custom TOC depth settings to modify the look of the outline. 
* Removed outline.css. Replaced it with new stylesheet.css (I don't want all my files to start with outline*).
* Added Outline-navigation.tpl.php, which is a slightly modified copy of book-navigation.tpl.php



18th April 2008
===============

* The upcoming Drupal 6 version of outline.module is a *complete rewrite* of the module.

* The Drupal 6 version of outline.module is now *dependent on* core's book.module, 
instead of being a replacement module, like in Drupal 5.

* The tables {outline_nodes} and {outline_volume} are replaced by 
{outline_node}, {outline_book}, {outline_perm} and {outline_types}
to accomodate for all the features planned in the upcoming release.

* There is a migration path from the Drupal 5 DB schema. The migration is not yet complete and needs testing.

* We replace the book.module javascript AHAH callback with our own, so we can customize the return value (add form elements).

* Any change in the outline settings at the node level is saved in the revision if 'create revision' is checked.

* The form elements to set the child page node, and the TOC depth view are directly inserted on the form node,
alongside book.module's form elements.

* The link 'add child node' is customized to take into account the child node type setting. 
The text of the link also specify the node type of the child node.


# tag DRUPAL-5--1-0 : 21st March 2007. 
# =======================================

* First official release for outline.module which is a replacement of Drupal core book.module.
